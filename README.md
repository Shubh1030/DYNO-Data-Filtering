This project performs advanced filtering and grouping of EV motor (PMSM) Dyno test data (from TDMS files) to extract optimal operating points using MTPA (Maximum Torque Per Ampere) and MTPV (Maximum Torque Per Volt) methods. It identifies efficiency-optimal current commands for different torque-speed conditions in an electric vehicle context. Key features: TDMS data parsing & preprocessing, MTPA & MTPV analysis modes (switchable via flag), Adaptive DBSCAN noise filtering, Grouping based on torque and speed, Identification of optimal operating points (T/A & T/V max), Interactive Plotly visualizations, Clean CSV exports for further study. Language: Python. Libraries: numpy, pandas, plotly, scikit-learn, scipy, nptdms
